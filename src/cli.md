# CLI

Ready to write a `paekli-cli`?
Here's what the final product might look like:

```
> paekli-cli send carrots --to lisa
Thank you for trusting Paekli LLC!
We will deliver your paekli in mint condition.

> paekli-cli receive --for jeremiah
Error: There is no paekli for jeremiah.

> paekli-cli receive --for lisa
Here is your paekli:
carrots
```

You probably already initialized a `paekli-cli` package during the project setup.
If you haven't, simply run `cargo new paekli-cli` to do so.

Let's get started!
