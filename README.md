This is a guide for an exercise project in Rust.
It is intended as the next thing to do after reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

The aim of paekli-rs is to bridge the gap between _the book_ and production-ready code, emphasizing among other things:
- library usage
- inter-process communication
- integration in a polyglot environment
- automated testing and delivery (CI/CD)
- having lots of fun! ðŸ˜ƒ

The guide is deployed at ðŸ‘‰ https://senekor.github.io/paekli-rs/
